# caseload-scheduling

This package is a Python-based tool for identifying the optimal schedule for a given
caseload, i.e., a set of cases/appointments of a given duration with a given number of
openings.

The scheduling is completed using a mixed-integer linear programming (MLIP) approach
with the pyomo package.
